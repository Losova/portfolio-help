I am a beginner developer who is currently trying to build a simple portfolio website using Next.js and TailwindCSS to showcase my projects and skills. I have been watching some tutorials on YouTube to relearn web development, as it's been about 5 years since I last coded a website. I am currently stuck on a specific task, which is importing videos as backgrounds for multiple pages including the main page and the project pages. I am having a hard time understanding how to properly import and implement videos as backgrounds with Next.js and TailwindCSS and would greatly appreciate any help or guidance on this issue. I think the code is pretty self explanatory, but ask me if you have any quetions or suggestions!
